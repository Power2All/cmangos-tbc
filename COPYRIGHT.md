About CMaNGOS Rust Implementation
---------------------------------

This is purely a experiment, and educational, non-commercial and non-profit project.

Out of boredom I started trying this, to see how feasable it was to convert this huge project to Rust, which I (Power2All) has been using for a while now.

Anything added to this project, is all based off CMaNGOS's official GitHub repository, and I do in no means claim to own the code.
