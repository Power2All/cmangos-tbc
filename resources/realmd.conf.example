# MaNGOS realmd configuration file (Rust)
#
# 	To overwrite configuration fields with environment variables
# 	use the following pattern to generate environment variable names:
#
# 		For WrongPass.MaxCount:
# 			export Realmd_WrongPass_MaxCount=10
#
# 		For RealmServerPort:
# 			export Realmd_RealmServerPort=3333

# REALMD SETTINGS
#
#    LoginDatabaseInfo
#        Database connection settings for the realm server.
#        Supports two formats:
#
#        Legacy CMaNGOS format:
#            hostname;port;username;password;database
#
#        URL format (recommended):
#            mysql://username:password@hostname:port/database
#            postgres://username:password@hostname:port/database
#            sqlite://path/to/db.sqlite
#
#    LogsDir
#         Logs directory setting.
#         Important: Logs dir must exist, or all logs will be disabled
#         Default: "" - no log directory prefix. If log names aren't absolute paths
#                       then logs will be stored in the current directory of the running program.
#
#    LogLevel
#         Server console level of logging
#         0 = Minimum (errors only)
#         1 = Error   (errors + warnings)
#         2 = Detail  (normal operation, default)
#         3 = Full    (debug-level: connections, queries, state changes)
#         4 = Trace   (everything: packet data, SRP6 internals, version checks)
#         Default: 2
#
#         Can also be overridden:
#           - CLI:  realmd --log-level 3
#           - Env:  RUST_LOG=debug    (standard Rust logging env var, takes highest priority)
#
#    LogFileLevel
#         Server file level of logging (same scale as LogLevel)
#         Allows file logging at a different verbosity than console.
#         Default: same as LogLevel
#
#    MaxPingTime
#         Settings for maximum database-ping interval (minutes between pings)
#
#    RealmServerPort
#         Port on which the server will listen
#
#    BindIP
#         Bind Realm Server to specific IP address
#         This option is useful for running multiple worldd/realmd instances
#         on different IP addresses using default ports.
#         DO NOT CHANGE THIS UNLESS YOU _REALLY_ KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
#
#    RealmsStateUpdateDelay
#        Realm list Update up delay (updated at realm list request if delay expired).
#        Default: 20
#                 0  (Disabled)
#
#    StrictVersionCheck
#        Description: Prevent modified clients from connecting
#        Default:     0 - (Disabled)
#                     1 - (Enabled)
#
#    WrongPass.MaxCount
#        Number of login attempts with wrong password before the account or IP is banned
#        Default: 0  (Never ban)
#
#    WrongPass.BanTime
#        Duration of the ban in seconds (0 means permanent ban)
#        Default: 600
#
#    WrongPass.BanType
#        Ban the IP or account on which login is attempted
#        Default: 0 (Ban IP)
#                 1 (Ban Account)
#
#    AutoCreateAccounts
#        Automatically create a new account when a player tries to log in
#        with a username that does not yet exist. The password used during
#        the first login attempt becomes the account's password.
#
#        WARNING: This is intended for DEVELOPMENT and TESTING only.
#                 Do NOT enable this on a public server.
#
#        Default: 0 - (Disabled)
#                 1 - (Enabled)
#
#    AutoCreateAccounts.Expansion
#        The expansion level granted to auto-created accounts.
#        0 = Classic (no expansion)
#        1 = The Burning Crusade
#        Default: 1
#
#    ConnectionTimeout
#        Timeout in seconds for idle client connections.
#        Applies to all read and write operations on the authentication socket.
#        If no data is received or sent within this period, the connection is dropped.
#        Protects against slowloris-style attacks that hold connections open indefinitely.
#        Default: 30
#
#    MaxConnectionsPerIP
#        Maximum number of simultaneous connections allowed from a single IP address.
#        Prevents a single source from exhausting server resources.
#        Default: 10 (0 = unlimited)
#
#    MaxConnections
#        Maximum total number of simultaneous connections the server will accept.
#        New connections beyond this limit are immediately rejected.
#        Default: 1000 (0 = unlimited)
